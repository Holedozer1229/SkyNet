# SKYNT Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive technical documentation for the SKYNT protocol.

## Documents

### 📘 [Whitepaper](whitepaper.md)
Complete technical specification covering:
- Protocol design and architecture
- Snake-II consensus mechanism
- Oracle-assisted optimization
- Zero-knowledge verification
- Cross-chain bridging
- Economic model and tokenomics
- Security analysis

**Audience**: Technical readers, developers, investors, and protocol researchers

---

### ✅ [Audit Checklist](audit-checklist.md)
Mainnet readiness checklist structured for professional auditors:
- Consensus & PoW verification
- Difficulty and halving mechanisms
- Zero-knowledge circuit correctness
- Oracle system security
- NFT and asset logic
- Bridge security
- Economic and legal compliance

**Audience**: Security auditors, protocol reviewers, and compliance teams

---

### 🧮 [Mathematical Appendix](mathematical-appendix.md)
Formal mathematical foundations including:
- Snake-II state transition proofs
- Score function definitions
- Difficulty convergence analysis
- Recursive ZK proof soundness
- Oracle game theory and slashing models
- ECDSA verification in R1CS
- Implementation parameters

**Audience**: Cryptographers, protocol engineers, and academic researchers

These documents are designed to be used together:

1. **Start with the Whitepaper** to understand the overall protocol design
2. **Reference the Mathematical Appendix** for formal proofs and specifications
3. **Use the Audit Checklist** to verify implementation correctness before mainnet
